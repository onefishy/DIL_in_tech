**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - what is the current landscape of diversity in tech? What seem to be (or are not) the main bottlenecks for achieving diversity? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experience in tech as a student of Data Science? 

#### Week 2: The Social/Cultural Factors

**Readings**
- Why Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?
- Born for it: How the image of software developers came about
- Silent Technical Privilege
- Black and brown tech workers share their experiences of racism on the job

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - what are the common threads in the testimonials in "Black and brown tech workers share their experiences of racism on the job"? Are these experiences related to the implicit biases and expectations that the other three articles identify as part of the dominant culture in tech? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experiences as a student of Data Science or experiences of those close to you? If these social/cultural factors contribute to the stymying of diversity, how can we address them? In particular, should the solutions be individual/personal/grassroots or institutional (what do the readings from last week and this week suggest)?
