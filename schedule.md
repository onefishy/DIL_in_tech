# Course Schedule

#### Week 1: Surveying the Landscape of Diversity in Tech

**Readings**
- Silicon Valley has its own long-standing systemic racial problem
- There Is a Supply of Diverse Workers in Tech, So Why Is Silicon Valley So Lacking in Diversity?
- Five Years of Tech Diversity Reportsâ€”and Little Progress
- Diversity Gaps in Computer Science:
Exploring the Underrepresentation of Girls, Blacks and Hispanics
- Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - what is the current landscape of diversity in tech? What seem to be (or are not) the main bottlenecks for achieving diversity? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experience in tech as a student of Data Science? 

#### Week 2: The Social/Cultural Factors

**Readings**
- Why Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?
- Born for it: How the image of software developers came about
- Silent Technical Privilege
- Black and brown tech workers share their experiences of racism on the job

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - what are the common threads in the testimonials in "Black and brown tech workers share their experiences of racism on the job"? Are these experiences related to the implicit biases and expectations that the other three articles identify as part of the dominant culture in tech? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experiences as a student of Data Science or experiences of those close to you? If these social/cultural factors contribute to the stymying of diversity, how can we address them? In particular, should the solutions be individual/personal/grassroots or institutional (what do the readings from last week and this week suggest)?

#### Week 3: Strategies for Diversifying Academia

**Readings**
- Holistic Review in Graduate Admissions
- Addressing the Challenge of Diversity in the Graduate Ranks: Good Practices Yield Good Outcomes
- Strategies to improve equity in faculty hiring
- Gender and Ethnic Bias in Letters of Recommendations
- Structural causes of inequities in STEM hiring and promising strategies for increasing diversity

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - are there common challenges in diversifying faculty and graduate student bodies? Are there common good practices? How do these practices address some of the structural/cultural barriers faced by UMRs in the readings from the previous weeks? 

#### Week 4: Diversity, Ethics and Social Justice in the Cirriculum

**Readings**
- Integrating data science ethics into an undergraduate major
- Active learning narrows achievement gaps forunderrepresented students in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math
- Are College Lectures Unfair?
- Controlled Fission: Teaching Supercharged Subjects
- Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice

**Response**
Summarize the information in the readings - why should we be addressing diversity, ethics and social justice in a data science classroom? What might be our goals and desired outcomes for our students by addressing these issues? What are some potential difficulties with meaningful integration of these issues into traditional classrooms? What are some promising ways for addressing these issues in a data science classroom? What are some ways you (personally) have encountered these issues in the classroom - were these experiences productive, difficult, frustrating?

#### Week 5: Relating Data Science Ethics and Diversity

**Readings**
- Automated Justice: A Review of Weapons of Math Destruction
- Excerpts from "Invisible Women"
- Excerpts from "Race After Technology"

**Response**
Summarize the information in the readings - this week's readings highlight the disparate impacts of technology (not just digital) on marginalized groups. Do you see themes in the ways technology can negative and unequally impact these groups? Do you see common sources for these disparaties (e.g. are these disparaties arising from malevolent actors/systems, are they anomalies/accidents)? To what degree does addressing ethical issues in data science requires one to address the issues of diversity and inclusion?
