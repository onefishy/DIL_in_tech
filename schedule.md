#### Week 1: Surveying the Landscape of Diversity in Tech

**Readings**

- Five Years of Tech Diversity Reports—and Little Progress
- Pinterest and the Subtle Poison of Sexism and Racism in Silicon Valley
- Why Silicon Valley’s Many Asian Americans Still Feel Like a Minority
- WHY IS SILICON VALLEY SO AWFUL TO WOMEN?

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - what is the current landscape of diversity in tech? What seem to be (or are not) the main bottlenecks for achieving diversity? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experience in tech as a student of Data Science?

Thinking ahead - What topics do you hope to explore in this seminar? What do you hope to gain from participating in this seminar?


#### Week 2: How Did Tech Become So Homogenous: the Social/Cultural/Historical Factors

**Readings**

  -   The Secret History of Women in Coding
  -    Critical Figures: Charting the History of ‘Black Software’ in Tech (a review of *Black Software*, which I highly recommend)
  -    Silicon Valley Isn't a Meritocracy. And It's Dangerous to Hero-Worship Entrepreneurs
  -    Silent Technical Privilege
  -    Born for it: How the image of software developers came about
  -    Why Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?


**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - in what ways do these readings challenge the popular narrative of the history, norms and values of the tech industry? Can you relate any part of your readings to your personal experiences as a student of Data Science or experiences of those close to you? The readings identify social/cultural factors that contribute to the stymying of diversity in tech, how can we address these obstacles? In particular, should the solutions be individual/personal/grassroots or institutional (what do the readings from last week and this week suggest)?


#### Week 3: How Does the Diversity/Homogeneity of Tech Affect the Products We Design and the Ways They Impact the World? 

**Readings**

  - Excerpts from Race After Technology
  - Excerpts from Automating Inequality
  - Excerpts from Invisible Women
  - [Talk based on Black Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WcCjL14iQ)


**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - this week's readings highlight the disparate impacts of technology (not just digital) on marginalized groups. Do you see themes in the ways technology can negatively and unequally impact these groups? Do you see common sources for these disparities (e.g. are these disparities arising from malevolent actors/systems, are they anomalies/accidents)? Relating this week's reading to ones from previous weeks, can you say to what extent does addressing ethical issues in data science require one to address the issues of diversity and inclusion in tech?


#### Week 4: What Are Our Obligations to Fix the Failings in/of Tech? What Are Pathways to Solutions?

We've surveyed the unequal representation in tech and the unequal impacts of tech. This might raise the questions: but what can be done and what should I do? This week's reading addresses these questions from philosophical foundations, presents practical frameworks and offers constructive critiques of solutions being offered.

**Response**

Summarize the information in the readings - in what ways is an individual data scientist obligated to engage with the ethical implications of their work (on what grounds would you argue that there is any obligation)? What are some ways the tech community have tried to address the broader impact (especially negative impact) of their products? What are the promises and pitfalls of these proposed fixes?

Since we've been discussing how data science curricula should prepare a student to tackle the intersection of technology and human values: Why should we be addressing diversity, ethics and social justice in a data science classroom? What might be our goals and desired outcomes for our students by addressing these issues? What are some potential difficulties with meaningful integration of these issues into traditional classrooms? What are some ways you (personally) have encountered these issues in the classroom - were these experiences productive, difficult, frustrating?
