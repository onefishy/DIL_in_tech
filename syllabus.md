# Course Syllabus

### What is this Course?

This course examines inequity in tech in two ways: 

1. by examining structural (e.g. cultural, social and institutional) factors underlying the low-levels of diversity in tech 
2. by examining the unequal social impact of technology in deployment. 

Through readings, students will gain familiarity with a wide rage of previously identified structural challenges for achieving equitable representation in tech and fair outcomes in when technology is integrated into social institutions. The focus of the course will be on identifying leadership opportunities and concrete strategies for making positive changes in tech communities (both in classroom and workplaces) as well as in the way that technology is deployed, used and monitored.

### General Information
This is a seminar course, wherein students are expected to shape and direct discussions, ***facilitated*** by the teaching staff. Students enrolled in this course are expected to serve on the IACS Student Committee on Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, wherein they will work on implementing the diversity/inclusion strategies developed in this course specifically to improve the IACS community.

There will be weekly reading assignments consisting of 2-3 articles (chosen from the [Main Reading List](./reading_list.html)), short weekly reading response and weekly discussion based class meetings.

### Course Schedule
TBA

### Reading Responses
For each set of weekly readings, studens are asked to write a short response (approximately 3-4 paragraphs, or more if anyone so wish) ***synthesizing*** and ***critically engaging*** with the reading materials. That is, we are ***not*** looking for a summary of the contents of the readings, rather we are asking for each student to engage with the ideas presented in the readings personally, intellectually and otherwise. 

The responses are graded for effort: did the student make an effort to read the articles thoughtfully and carefully? Did the student reflect on and evaluate the ideas presented in the readings? Did the student relate the ideas presented in the readings to their own experiences or the experiences of their peers?

### Attendance and Participation
Students are expected to attend every class meeting and participate actively. Meaningful and constructive dialogue is crucial for this class and this requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to listen, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will be maintained at all times in this class. One’s words and use of language should be temperate and students are encouraged to proactively build-up the ideas of others. Simulatenously, real change (emotional, intellectual and social) does not happen without effort, disruption and discomfort, as such, students are also encouraged to challenge the ideas of their peers and well as their own beliefs.

### Respect for Diversity
It is the mission of the teaching staff that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We aim to create a learning environment that is inclusive and respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions for how to better our classroom community are always encouraged and appreciated.
