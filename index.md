# General Course Information

**Course Instructor**

- [Dr. Weiwei Pan](https://onefishy.github.io) (Harvard University) 

**What is this Course?**

This course examines inequity in tech in two ways: 

1. by examining structural (e.g. cultural, social and institutional) factors underlying the low-levels of diversity in tech 
2. by examining the unequal social impact of technology in deployment. 

Through readings, students will gain familiarity with a wide range of previously identified structural challenges for achieving equitable representation in tech and fair outcomes when technology is integrated into social institutions. The focus of the course will be on identifying leadership opportunities and concrete strategies for making positive changes in tech communities (both in classroom and workplaces) as well as in the way that technology is deployed, used and monitored.
