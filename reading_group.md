# Spring 2022 Diversity, Inclusion and Leadership in Tech Reading Group
This is a reading group for IACS students and affliates on issues of diversity and inclusion, focusing on how to take leadership in creating more equitable and just communities in tech. The reading group is supported and facilitated by members of the [IACS Graduate Advisory Committee](https://iacs-gac.github.io/pages/about.html) as well as by IACS faculty and staff.

This reading group is a not-for-credit continuation of the Fall [Diversity, Inclusion and Leadership Seminar](https://onefishy.github.io/DIL_in_tech/). The reading group will be bimonthly and discuss papers on topics that are chosen by both group facilitators as well as participants. 

We welcome folks of all backgrounds in the wider IACS community to [sign-up for the reading group](https://forms.gle/JdwvyXTbErmSM99c6)!

## Schedule

**February 4th, 3.30pm-4.30pm** Introductions

- *Reading:* Prerequisite Readings
- *Suggested discussion questions:*  
  - From the readings, what is your sense of the current landscape of diversity in tech? Does this align with your personal experiences in academia/industry?
  - From the readings, how might one argue for increasing diversity in tech -- i.e. why is diversity in tech important, what are some of the negative consequences of the lack of diversity. Does this align with your personal experiences in academia/industry?
  - From the readings, what are the obstacles to diversifying tech? Where are the leadership opportunities for change in the wider tech community? Where are they at IACS or Harvard?
  - What would you like to get out of this reading group? What topics/issues would you like to explore?

**February 11th, 3.30pm-4.30pm** DIB Coffee Hour with Erin Erhart

**February 18th, 3.30pm-4.30pm** Building Trust Across Differences & Tackling Difficult Subjects

- *Reading:* 
  - [Introduction to Community Psychology: RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY](https://press.rebus.community/introductiontocommunitypsychology/chapter/respect-for-diversity/)
  - [Guide for Navigating Difficult Conversations on Race](https://www.utc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-08/UTC%20Race%20Discussion%20Guide%20%28Aug%202020%29.pdf)
  - [Situating the Scientist: Creating Inclusive Science Communication Through Equity Framing and Environmental Justice](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00006/full)

- *Suggested discussion questions:*
  - How would you explain the differences between cultural humility and cultural competence? Why is cultural humility more beneficial for understanding diversity? (
  - What role might cultural humility play in navigating difficult conversations (e.g. about race)? In particular, which concrete suggestions in [Guide for Navigating Difficult Conversations on Race](https://www.utc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-08/UTC%20Race%20Discussion%20Guide%20%28Aug%202020%29.pdf) might exemplify cultural humility.
  - The guidelines provided in [Guide for Navigating Difficult Conversations on Race](https://www.utc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-08/UTC%20Race%20Discussion%20Guide%20%28Aug%202020%29.pdf) is for navigating conversations about race. Which aspects of these guidelines are generalizable to other conversations about sensitive topics or to situations where we need to build trust across differences?
  - Last week, we brought up the question of how to have conversations about issues that acknowledge harm (to individuals, communities etc). In what ways might we be neglecting to address harm in the current scientfic/professional discourse on data science? In [Situating the Scientist: Creating Inclusive Science Communication Through Equity Framing and Environmental Justice](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00006/full), can equity framing provide a way to acknowledge and address harm?
  - How does framework proposed in [Situating the Scientist: Creating Inclusive Science Communication Through Equity Framing and Environmental Justice](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00006/full) relate to cultural humility and the principles described in [Guide for Navigating Difficult Conversations on Race](https://www.utc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-08/UTC%20Race%20Discussion%20Guide%20%28Aug%202020%29.pdf)?
